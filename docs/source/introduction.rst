What is Compi?
================

Compi is an application development framework for portable computational pipelines.
A software pipeline is a chain of processing elements so that the output of each 
element is the input of the next.

There are many fields where computational pipelines constitute the main
architecture of applications, such as big data analysis or bioinformatics.

Many pipelines combine third party tools along with custom made processes,
conforming the final pipeline. Compi is the framework helping you to create the
final - and portable - application.
