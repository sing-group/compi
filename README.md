# Compi: framework for portable computational pipelines [![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/sing-group/compi)](https://github.com/sing-group/compi) [![release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/sing-group/compi.svg)](http://www.sing-group.org/compi)

Compi is an application development framework for portable computational pipelines. A software pipeline is a chain of processing elements so that the output of each element is the input of the next.

There are many fields where computational pipelines constitute the main architecture of applications, such as big data analysis or bioinformatics.

Many pipelines combine third party tools along with custom made processes, conforming the final pipeline. Compi is the framework helping to create the final, portable application.
